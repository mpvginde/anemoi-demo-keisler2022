# Anemoi onboarding with Keisler 2022

## üí° Main idea

We propose to build an **educational** and **onboarding** demo project within the Anemoi framework by **reproducing** the model presented in the seminal work of **Keisler 2022**. This demo project will provide a practical, step-by-step pipeline: from dataset preparation to model verification and visualization, specifically tailored for teaching and training purposes.

In short:
- Create an accessible and fully documented demo repository demonstrating the **complete MLWP pipeline using Anemoi**.
- Enhance **understanding** of the **scientific principles** underlying graph-based MLWP models.
- **Simplify** the **onboarding** experience for new users by showcasing a clear, real-world example.
- Provide **educational material** suitable for lectures and practical exercises for students learning MLWP

## ‚õ©Ô∏è Philosophy
- The project must offer a pleasant introduction to MLWP and invite users to think more deeply about the MLWP problem statement and the choices made when building a MLWP-model.
- Bridge the gap between `anemoi-docs` and `anemoi-configs` on the one hand and the different `anemoi` packages on the other hand.
- Explain the scientific and technical choices made
- Interact as much as possible with `anemoi-docs` and other existing literature.
